# virtual-conductor

## Setup 

This is a guide on how to get started with hosting this project locally.


### 1: Cloning the project

Use the following git command to clone the repo to a suitable folder on your device:

```
git clone https://github.com/DT2140-Project/virtual-conductor.git
```

This will give you a folder called **virtual-conductor** where all the development will be done. 

### 2: Hosting a local server

The simplest way to host a local server is by using chrome and the chrome extension Web Server for Chrome, which you can find [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb/related?pli=1). Add the chrome extension and start it up, selecting the **virtual-conductor** folder from the previous part as the folder you're hosting.
Then you should be able to visit the Web Server URL [http://127.0.0.1:8887](http://127.0.0.1:8887) to view the web app locally.
